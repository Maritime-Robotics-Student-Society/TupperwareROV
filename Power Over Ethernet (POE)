Power over ethernet is viable for our application as long as the tether does not exceed approximately 5-10m. 
This is unlikely but if required then application specific conductors must be considered.

Power over ethernet will involve splicing both ends of the cable.

Pin 4, 5, 7 and 8 are all reserved and availible to splice. 
A standard 12V DC power brick can be used to provide power to the splice.
Power will send supply to 5V and or 6V regulator for LED array and Motor circuits.
